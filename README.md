# Credit Scoring Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **Credit Scoring Model** to predict whether an individual is likely to **default on a loan** based on their financial and personal information.  
It is a **binary classification** problem and is completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To classify loan applicants as:
- **0 → Creditworthy (No Default)**
- **1 → Not Creditworthy (Default)**

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains historical financial data with features such as:
- Age
- Income
- Employment length
- Loan amount
- Loan interest rate
- Loan intent
- Credit history
- Past default records

Target column:
- `loan_status`
